# Code Review

- This project is just a place to store some reviewed code.
- The original is in `original-main.rs`
- My version is the new `main.rs`

This uses the input crate to make getting input easier, but otherwise is standard library only.

It isn't perfect, but was just designed to show some more rusty ways to do things.

I'm only an intermediate rust user, so I'm sure others can do much better than this.

Hopefully it is helpful though.
